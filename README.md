# Splitter

Splitter is a social music sharing platform built using Ruby on Rails that allows users to follow friends, share music theyâ€™re listening to, make comments, and suggest music for others. Technologies used in creating this app also include PostgreSQL, JQuery, AJAX, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, as well as the Spotify API. This was also my first time utilizing Rails' Action Cable feature in order to make updates happen in real time.

Thursday, January 5th, 2017: Splitter will no longer be live as I continue to work on the project.
